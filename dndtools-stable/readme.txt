To start running this, just open index.html in any current web browser. Stable comes with two royalty free sounds, A nighttime "music" file and a "sword_hit"
"sound" affect. The difference between sounds and music is that sounds will play everytime it is clicked, multiple will overlap each other without disrupting
them. Music on the otherhand will play only one song at a time, loop it and fade to the next when a new one is selected. To add your own sound affects and 
music simply add their name minus their file extention to the array in main.js and throw their files in the "sounds" directory. chrome browser will need
.mp3 files and firefox will use .ogg format.

Additionally there is loot generation based on gold awarded at the top. To edit the loot table see the first array in lootGen.js. Secondly there is a die 
rolling system for d20 games. You input the number of dies, the letter 'd' and then how many sides all the dies should have.
